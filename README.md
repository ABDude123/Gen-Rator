# Code Generator Website

This project is a premium code generator website built with Flask for the backend and a sleek, luxurious frontend inspired by the design aesthetics of brands like Rolls-Royce and Apple. The site continuously generates random 18-character alphanumeric codes and checks their validity using the Discord API. If the generated code is valid, it sends a notification to a configured Discord webhook.

## Features
- **Random Code Generation**: Generates a random 18-character alphanumeric string.
- **Discord API Integration**: Checks generated codes against Discord's API.
- **Discord Webhook Notification**: Sends valid codes to a configured Discord webhook.
- **Premium Frontend Design**: The website has a luxurious, modern design with sleek fonts, dark theme, and metallic accents.
